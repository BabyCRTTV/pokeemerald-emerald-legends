# Changelog

All notable Pokémon Emerald: Legends project changes will be documented here.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-10-07

### Added
- Added separate Release and Debug distributions built from the same Pokémon Emerald: Legends source.
- Added a Debug download directly below the recommended Release download on the project website.
- Added browser-patcher support for both Release and Debug builds.
- Added distinct in-game version identification for Debug builds as `LEGENDS v0.0.2-D`.

### Changed
- The recommended player build now uses the expansion's native release configuration, disabling developer/debug entry points while preserving all Legends gameplay and content changes.
- The Debug build retains the overworld debug menu, battle debug menu, Pokémon sprite visualizer, and title-screen Quickstart tools supplied by the expansion base.
- The automated release pipeline now builds, patches, reapplies, and byte-for-byte verifies both Release and Debug variants before publishing them.
- Release filenames now use `Pokemon-Emerald-Legends-v0.0.2.bps` and `Pokemon-Emerald-Legends-v0.0.2-debug.bps`.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-10-07

### Added
- Added a centered `LEGENDS` subtitle to the Emerald title screen while preserving the original Pokémon Emerald logo artwork.
- Added `LEGENDS v0.0.1` identification to the in-game Options menu header.
- Added a release/download section to the project website in preparation for patch distributions.
- Added an in-browser BPS patcher that verifies a clean Emerald ROM and creates the playable `.gba` locally without uploading the source ROM.
- Added a reproducible CI workflow that builds and verifies the v0.0.1 BPS patch from decompiled source.
- Established Pokémon Emerald: Legends project identity.
- Adopted `pokeemerald-expansion` as the upstream base.
- Added project roadmap and development documentation.
- Added feature design documents for EXP changes, overworld field moves, and seasons.
- Added an initial GitHub Pages landing site.
- Added repository contribution and feature-request structure.

### Changed
- Established `0.0.1` as the authoritative current development baseline.
- Added an explicit versioning policy: each meaningful shipped change increments the development revision and receives a matching changelog entry.
- Updated release tooling so BPS filenames are derived from the root `VERSION` file.

### Planned during 0.0.x development
- Implement the revised EXP Share behavior already designed during development.
- Implement HM/field-move use from the overworld without requiring a dedicated HM move slot.
- Research and prototype a configurable seasonal system.
