# Pokémon Emerald: Legends

**Version:** 0.0.1  
**Base:** [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion)

Pokémon Emerald: Legends is an unofficial, non-commercial Pokémon Emerald ROM-hack project built on the open-source `pokeemerald-expansion` decompilation/expansion base.

The project is intended to preserve the feel and structure of Pokémon Emerald while layering in modern quality-of-life improvements, configurable mechanics, expanded systems, and new features developed incrementally.

## Try the current v0.0.1 build

The project site includes a browser-based patcher:

- **Project site:** https://babycrttv.github.io/pokeemerald-emerald-legends/
- **Browser patcher:** https://babycrttv.github.io/pokeemerald-emerald-legends/patcher.html
- **BPS patch:** https://babycrttv.github.io/pokeemerald-emerald-legends/downloads/Pokemon-Emerald-Legends-v0.0.1.bps

The browser patcher verifies a clean U.S./Europe Pokémon Emerald ROM (SHA-1 `f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7`) and creates `Pokemon-Emerald-Legends-v0.0.1.gba` locally in the browser. The source ROM is never uploaded.

## Development philosophy

- Preserve the recognizable Emerald adventure as the foundation.
- Prefer configurable features over hard-coded behavior where practical.
- Reuse `pokeemerald-expansion` systems before introducing duplicate implementations.
- Keep custom mechanics documented and isolated so upstream updates remain manageable.
- Never commit or distribute a commercial Pokémon ROM.

## Initial 0.0.x focus

The first development milestone establishes the project structure and prepares the first custom systems:

- EXP system adjustments
- Overworld field moves / HM quality-of-life system
- Seasonal world and encounter framework
- Project configuration documentation
- Reproducible build workflow
- GitHub Pages project site

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and the documentation in [`docs/features`](docs/features).
